# What is git?

>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS), more like a tool, to track changes in source code from small to large projects over time. It’s a collaborative approach to bring developers and programmers from around the world under one roof to share one common interest – coding. Git is basically a source code management tool used to manage projects or a set of files that change over time and catalog them on a particular data structure called repositories.
