***`Video link of the Git video:` https://youtu.be/gwWKnnCMQ5c***

## Things we learned in the video
 - Initializing repository
 - Making different files and folders
 - About `.gitignore`
 - About adding, commits(with some message)
 - Reverting the changes or mistakes made
 - Branches, switching in different branches
 - Frequently checking git status
 - Merging branches into main or master branch
 - About github and `cloning`
 - About `Readme.md` file of github
 - Uploading your local repository(in your computer) to github repository`(remote repository)`

## Main commands we used throughout this video are:
```diff
 git init                                                       (start your repository)
 git status                                                     (check status)
 git status -s                                                  (smart status check)
 git checkout yourfilename.extension                            (undo uncommitted changes)
 git checkout -f                                                (undo uncommitted changes forcely)
 git branch                                                     (check which branch you are in)
 git branch branch_name                                         (create a branch)
 git checkout branch_name                                       (move to that branch)
 git switch branch_name                                         (move to that branch)
 git merge branch_name                                          (merge the branch in current branch)
 git rm --cached                                                (remove the files from staging area)
 git log -p -1                                                  (shows last log)
 git log -p -2                                                  (shows last two logs)
 git log --oneline                                              (shows each log commits in oneline)
 git remote add origin GitProfileLink                           (connecting to remote repository)
 git push origin master                                         (push to remote repository)
 git push -u origin master                                      (creating upstream for branch master here)
 git push                                                       (directly push if upstream is created)
 touch somefile                                                 (make file using touch)

```
